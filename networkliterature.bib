	abstract = {We study cascades of failures in a network of interdependent financial
organizations: how discontinuous changes in asset values
(e.g., defaults and shutdowns) trigger further failures, and how this
depends on network structure. Integration (greater dependence on
counterparties) and diversification (more counterparties per organization) have different, nonmonotonic effects on the extent of cascades. Diversification connects the network initially, permitting
cascades to travel; but as it increases further, organizations are
better insured against one another's failures. Integration also faces
trade-offs: increased dependence on other organizations versus less
sensitivity to own investments. Finally, we illustrate the model with
data on European debt cross-holdings.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, Algorithms for Convex Optimization have revolutionized algorithm design, both for discrete and continuous optimization problems. For problems like maximum flow, maximum matching, and submodular function minimization, the fastest algorithms involve essential methods such as gradient descent, mirror descent, interior point methods, and ellipsoid methods. The goal of this self-contained book is to enable researchers and professionals in computer science, data science, and machine learning to gain an in-depth understanding of these algorithms. The text emphasizes how to derive key algorithms for convex optimization from first principles and how to establish precise running time bounds. This modern text explains the success of these algorithms in problems of discrete optimization, as well as how these methods have significantly pushed the state of the art of convex optimization itself.},
