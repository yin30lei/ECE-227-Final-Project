	abstract = {We study cascades of failures in a network of interdependent financial
organizations: how discontinuous changes in asset values
(e.g., defaults and shutdowns) trigger further failures, and how this
depends on network structure. Integration (greater dependence on
counterparties) and diversification (more counterparties per organization) have different, nonmonotonic effects on the extent of cascades. Diversification connects the network initially, permitting
cascades to travel; but as it increases further, organizations are
better insured against one another's failures. Integration also faces
trade-offs: increased dependence on other organizations versus less
sensitivity to own investments. Finally, we illustrate the model with
data on European debt cross-holdings.},
